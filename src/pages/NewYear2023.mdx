Both the calendar year and progress on my new website have decided to come to a close on the last day of 2022. In
accordance with the time of year I believe some introspection, retrospection, and prospection is in order!

## Looking Back on 2022

While I'm eager to dive into all the goals and things I have planned for the upcoming year, 2022 deserves to be
examined and thanked. What good are experiences if you don't look back and learn from them?

The first 5-6 months of the year were spent finishing up my sophomore spring semester. Outside of classwork and
finals, I'm struggling to recall anything notable from that time period, which bothers me. A lot.

Over the past couple of months, learning and the creation of valuable
experiences have become very important to me. I want to meet more people! I want
to know more interesting things and speak with others about them! I want to
understand things and become more articulate!

I don't want to <span className="font-bold text-red-800">waste time</span>.

With that being the broad statement that it is, let's define what I consider a
"waste" of time: any activity in which my mind is not critically engaged or I'm
not challenged in some way.

My intent isn't to massacre all leisure activities in my life or sound like some
high-roading STEMlord. Admittedly, I spent a lot of my idle time this year
simply trying to stimulate myself. I barely allocated myself time to listen to
my thoughts or read and frequently gave in to instant gratification.

2022 illustrated to me that I'm not challenging myself as much as I know I can.
This year's plan, at a high level, is to migrate my leisure time into more
productive, interesting, and challenging pursuits.

## Summer + Internship

Whew. That last section probably gave the impression that my entire year was an unproductive
shit show. Promise it wasn't.

The summer brought along an internship to keep me busy. Fantastic experience all
around. Thankfully, I was placed on a team that gave a shit! They never shied
away from answering my intern questions or helping me work through my
challenges. One of the most constructive experiences of my developer life, bar
none.

I learned Golang, participated in both sides of code reviews, and picked the
brains of some vary talented people. The thing I got to design and build was
actually relevant to the team as well. Whether or not they're still using it
today; I'm grateful to my manager for not throwing my intern self to the "React
Dashboard" wolves (something other managers at the company are infamous for
doing).

While working over the summer, I had the privilege of living with one of my good
friends. We watched a lot of kino together, became homeowners for a brief period
of time, and lifted in the 100+ degree Texas heat in his garage. He's one of
those friends I never want to lose contact with, and continues to inspire me to
this day. Shout out Breakable Men.

## 2022 -- The Back Half

The return to school from 3 months as a grown-up in industry had me motivated as
ever. YouTube's algorithm blessed me with [Theo Browne](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg)'s channel where I once more became enamored with web technologies. Theo's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzwaaWH0ksk) on goal setting was a beneficial kick in the teeth for me. I used to be so concerned with lacking dev knowledge that I found myself consuming media about technologies rather than just building cool shit with it!

I got to building.

September - December saw the release of several projects of mine:

- [Sauce](https://github.com/cadecuddy/sauce) - my novelty anime identification CLI
  tool.
- [Equihire](htts://github.com/cadecuddy/equihire) - a hackathon project: an inclusive
  resume screening web app.
- [Mastermind](https://main.d21udxm8rad8sx.amplifyapp.com/) - the 1970s puzzle game,
  written in 4 hours on Thanksgiving.
- [GeoSleuth](https://github.com/cadecuddy/GeoSleuth) - [current project] full-stack
  GeoGuessr-esque web app

Theo was absolutely right. I've learned more in the past couple months about
full stack development principles, database choices and design paradigms by
just... building shit. Moving forward I want to focus on more "serious" projects
i.e. devtools, startup, etc.

## Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

I made it much further than last year in Advent of Code - up to day 14 this time.
I'd frequently stay up until midnight (when the questions released) to attempt a
spot on the leaderboard. This was sustainable for... you guessed it: 2 weeks. It
really messed with my sleep schedule. By day 14 I had to move back home for winter
break anyway, falling off the wagon as a result.

My leaderboard aspirations were not in vain! I'll forever be on the Advent of
Code 2022 [question 4 leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/day/4) forever ðŸ˜Ž [peep 54th]

## Technologies Learned ðŸ’»

**Golang** - learned at internship. Fast, but Rust is faster. <br />
**NextJs** - best fullstack React framework out there. <br />
**TypeScript** - I now am aware of typesafety's importance. <br />
**tRPC** - typesafe client-sever communication. What's REST? <br />
**Prisma / ORMs** - Made interfacing w/DBs ezaf. <br />

## This Year's Reading List ðŸ“š

- Billionaire Wilderness - Justin Farell
- Cryptonomicon - Neal Stephenson
- The War Below - James Scott
- Numerous H.P. Lovecraft works...

## Looking towards 2023

I'll keep this concise. 2023 is the year of: building, reading, socializing, and
pursuing interesting/meaningful hobbies and experiences. Development of critical
thought will be an important focus as well. Frequently I find myself looking to others
for opinions without thinking critically myself. Alas.

Last, the technologies I'm learning or diving deeper into this year:

- **TypeScript**
- **Astro**
- **tRPC**
- **Docker**
- **More AWS**
- **Raspberry Pi** - Have a project idea for this :)
- **Rust** - Used extensively from 2020-21 but picking up again.
- **Distributed Systems** - My copy of DDIA is in the mail as of writing this.

2022 was great. Let's make 2023 better.
